# Library Management System (Python)

A console-based Library Management System developed in Python, demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. It supports book and member management, book issuance, returns, and uses **JSON files** for persistent data storage.

## Features

### ðŸ“˜ Book Management
- Add new books (handles existing ISBNs by updating quantity)
- View all books in the library
- Search for books by title, author, or ISBN

### Member Management
- Add new members (Students and Faculty)
- View all registered members with details and borrowed books

### Issue/Return Books
- Issue books to members (checks availability and limits)
- Return books from members

### Data Persistence
- All data is stored in `books.json`, `members.json`, and `issued_books.json`
- Data is loaded/saved automatically after relevant operations

### User-Friendly Interface
- Menu-driven CLI for easy interaction

## Object-Oriented Design

### `Book`
- Represents a single book
- **Encapsulation:** `_title`, `_author`, `_isbn`, `_total_quantity`, `_available_quantity`
- **Serialization:** `to_dict()` and `from_dict()`

### `Member` (Abstract Base Class)
- Base for `Student` and `Faculty`
- **Attributes:** `_member_id`, `_name`
- **Polymorphism:** `get_max_books_allowed()` (overridden)
- **Serialization:** `to_dict()` with class name

### `Student` (Inherits Member)
- Adds `_student_id`
- Borrow limit: 3 books

### `Faculty` (Inherits Member)
- Adds `_department`
- Borrow limit: 10 books

### `LibrarySystem`
- Manages `_books`, `_members`, `_issued_books`
- Loads/saves data from JSON
- Handles operations: `add_book()`, `issue_book()`, `return_book()`, etc.
- Provides menu-driven CLI interface (`run()` method)

## Data Files Used

- `books.json`: List of books
- `members.json`: 
  ```json
  {
    "students": [...],
    "faculty": [...]
  }
